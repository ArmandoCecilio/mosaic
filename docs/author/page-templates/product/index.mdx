## Overview

**Instruction**: The overview is the first paragraph on the Product Overview landing page that users read, so it’s critical that the content quickly and clearly describes what your product does.

This segment should convey your product’s technical value proposition (elevator pitch), higher-level benefits to LoBs and other readers, highlight a selection of your product’s technical features and engage readers.

The overview should include **1-2** opening paragraphs that total a **maximum of 150 words**.

**Suggested UI component**:

- [Cards](../components/card)

## How it works

**Instruction**: This section explains your product’s functionality, how it helps users achieve desired outcomes, the processes and interactions involved, key implementation information, etc.

We recommend that you include a functional diagram such as a flow chart or another visual aid here to better illustrate your product’s workflows and processes.

In lieu of a visual, use bulleted or numbered lists to break up your content and make it more scannable. Limit any text in this section to **150** words.

**Suggested content**:

- Text
- Image

## Get started

**Instruction**: This call-to-action (CTA) section explains the initial steps the user must take to explore and begin using your product.

Depending on the maturity and complexity of your product, you have two options:

- Point the CTA to your technical documentation.
  1. Verify that your technical documentation is available on the website, and ensure the Resources tab is populated with the relevant product tiles.
  2. Update the CTA button text to “GO TO DOCUMENTATION” and ensure the hyperlink is points to the product’s corresponding Resources tab.
  3. You may add additional text within this section encouraging users to review your technical documentation. Limit your text to **35** words.
- Point your CTA to your support channel.
  1. Verify that you have a support channel through which the reader can contact your team.
  2. Update the CTA button text to “GET IN TOUCH” and ensure the hyperlink includes a 'mailto' designation.
  3. You may add additional text within this section encouraging users to get in touch. Limit your text to **50** words.

**Suggested UI components**:

- [Feature](../components/feature)
- [Button](../components/button)

### Example

<Feature image={'./img/author/placeholder-product-hero-feature-552x414.png'}>
  <FeatureTitle>Get started</FeatureTitle>
  <FeatureContent>
    <P2>
      State the product readiness at the beginning so that users know the state of the product: - If
      the product is **Ready for co-development** or **Ready for consultation**, provide team
      contact and/or support information. - If the product is **Ready to use**, list the link to the
      technical documentation for implementation. You can also provide the link to the console.
    </P2>
  </FeatureContent>
  <FeatureActions>
    <Button href={'/starter/author/page-templates/product/resources'}>Go to documentation</Button>
  </FeatureActions>
</Feature>

## Related products

**Instruction**: Provide links to any related products that are featured on the website.
Ensure you use the latest product names and descriptions.
