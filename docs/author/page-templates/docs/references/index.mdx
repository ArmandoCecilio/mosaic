**Instruction**: Reference topics that provide data in support of the performance of a task.

Reference topics may provide lists and tables that include your product specifications, constraints on use or performance, and other data that is often “looked up” rather than memorized.

A reference topic may also describe regular constituents of a subject or product, such as commands in a programming languagel or required tools for a series of maintenance tasks.

Examples for references include:

- Parameters and attributes
- Commands and scripts
- Disaster recovery
- Interfaces
- Options

<Callout>API or SDK references would be a separate, unique section itself.</Callout>
