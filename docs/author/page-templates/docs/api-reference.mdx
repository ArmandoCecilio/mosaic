**Instruction**: If your product has Open APIs that users can use, you need to document API endpoints, which usually consist of the following sections:

- **Resource descriptions**: Resources refers to the information returned by an API.
- **Endpoints and methods**: The endpoints indicate how users can access the resource, while the method indicates the allowed interactions (such as `GET`, `POST`, or `DELETE`) with the resource.
- **Parameters**: Parameters are options that users can pass with the endpoint (such as specifying the response format or the amount returned) to influence the response.
- **Sample requests**: The request example includes a sample request using the endpoint, showing some parameters configured.
- **Sample responses** and **schemas**: The response example shows a sample response from the request example; the response schema defines all possible elements in the response.

<Callout variant="warning">
  Though reference topics in APIs generally receive the most attention, the conceptual topics, such
  as get-started tutorials, information about authorization, rate limiting, status and error codes,
  quick reference guides, and other topics constitute about half of the API documentation.
