Welcome to the Author documentation! Here, you will learn how to create engaging and informative content using MDX, Mosaic components, and page templates.

## Adding a New Page

Adding a new page to your Mosaic site is easy! Simply follow these steps:

Create a new .mdx file in the folder that your source is pointing at. You can also create pages in a new folder inside the source folder, but remember that each folder must have an index.mdx file.

Add frontmatter to the top of the file, like this:

```markdown
---
title: My New Page
layout: DetailTechnical
sidebar:
  priority: 2
---

# My New Page

This is my new page!
```

Save the file and your new page will be added to your Mosaic site. If you are working with a remote source, then you will have to commit and push the file first.

## Customizing Your pages

Mosaic allows you to customize your pages using a variety of tools, including:

- [Frontmatter](./frontmatter): Configure your pages using metadata.
- [Page Templates](./page-templates): Apply a consistent layout to your pages.
- [Aliases](./aliases): Create custom URLs for your pages.
- [Refs](./refs): Reference metadata from other pages in your page.
- [Fragments](./fragments): Reuse content across multiple pages.
