## Overview

As content authors, you can use lists to organize items or lists in an easily scannable way.

Lists can appear in either ordered or unordered formats depending on the content included:

- Ordered list for steps.
- Unordered list for others.

You can also mix ordered lists with unordered lists. You can also nest one list within another list to create multi-level lists.
