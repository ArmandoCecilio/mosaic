## Overview

A callout component sits within bodies of text and uses visual cues to draw attention to an
important piece of information. The callout variants differ based on the type of text and levels of
emphasis to be displayed.

<Callout>Add callout text here.</Callout>

## Usage

**Maximum character count within a callout**: We recommend that you do not include more than 300
characters within a callout. Callouts should be concise and to-the-point excerpts. For lengthy text,
consider using plain paragraphs instead.

### Callout variants

| Important       | Medium     | Used to draw attention to important information that accompanies the main body content.                                                                                                  |

| Warning         | High       | Stronger than **Caution**, which shows a potentially dangerous situation that, if not avoided, might result in a system error or technical failure. Usually, it means **Don't do this**. |
