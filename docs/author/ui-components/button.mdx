## Usage

Each button can have a label and icon to express the action to occur.

As content authors, when you use buttons, bear in
mind the following notes:

- Don't use buttons as navigation elements. Use
  [links](./link) instead.
- Start a button label with an active verb, and keep the label **within only one or two words** in
  length though the maximum character count for a button label is 16.
- Icons can be used in place of or to accompany a button label. However, ensure that the icon has a
  strong visual link to the action or is a commonly recognized visual reference.

### Button variants

- **Call-to-action (CTA) buttons**
  - CTA buttons are used to initiate the most important action on a screen. They should appear only
    once per screen (excluding modals/dialogs or app headers).
- **Regular (primary) buttons**
  - Regular buttons are used independently for lower priority or actions that do not require
    immediate attention. They can appear multiple times on a screen or page.
- **Secondary buttons**
  - Secondary buttons are used to provide an alternative or opposite action to the CTA button. They
    should only be used in conjunction with a CTA button as part of a pair.
